## About Me

I am a computational biologist working at the intersection of cancer genomics, nucleosome positioning, and machine learning. My research focuses on identifying driver mutations, modeling cancer-specific signatures, and developing computational tools for precision oncology.

I have experience building deep learning frameworks integrating sequence, structural, and network-based features for mutation classification across multiple cancer types.
